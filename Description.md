> **NB:**

1.  **All the records are inquiries but not all lead to bookings. The
    inquiry only becomes bookings when the value in the Booked column is
    \"Yes\".**

2.  **Revenue is only earned when inquiries become bookings**

3.  **Occupants (adults and children) are for only confirmed bookings**
